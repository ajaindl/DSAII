# DSAII

This is a project I did for an undergrad Data Structures and Algorithms class. The premise of the project was the classic Traveling Salesman problem, in this case routing packages 
to addresses while handling package prioritization, delivery truck capacity, and truck availability, and do so in an efficient and timely manner.
